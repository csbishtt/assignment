    "#Q2. What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. There are several methods and tools available for web scraping, depending on the complexity of the task and the technologies used in the web pages. Here are some common methods used for web scraping:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-Using Libraries like BeautifulSoup and Requests: Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and Requests are commonly used for web scraping. BeautifulSoup is used for parsing HTML and XML documents, while Requests is used for making HTTP requests to fetch the web page's content. These libraries work well for simple scraping tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-Scrapy: Scrapy is a powerful and extensible web scraping framework in Python. It provides a more structured and scalable approach to web scraping. Scrapy allows you to define spiders, which are classes that define how to navigate the website, extract data, and follow links. It is suitable for more complex and large-scale web scraping projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3-Selenium: Selenium is primarily used for web automation and testing, but it can also be utilized for web scraping tasks. It allows you to programmatically control a web browser, which can be helpful for websites that heavily rely on JavaScript for content rendering. By automating a browser, you can interact with JavaScript-rendered content and extract data dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "4-APIs: Some websites offer APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow you to access their data in a structured manner. Using APIs is a legitimate and preferred way to obtain data from websites that provide this access.\n",
    "\n",
    "5-Regular Expressions: Regular expressions can be used to extract specific patterns of data from HTML pages. While this method can work for simple cases, it is not recommended for complex web pages, as regular expressions can become hard to maintain and error-prone.\n",

    "#Q3. What is Beautiful Soup? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "'''Beautiful Soup is a Python library used for web scraping tasks. It is designed to parse HTML and XML documents and extract relevant data from them in a convenient and intuitive way. Beautiful Soup provides tools for navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree (the hierarchical structure representing the HTML or XML document), making it easier to extract specific information from web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features and benefits of Beautiful Soup:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-Parsing HTML and XML: Beautiful Soup takes raw HTML or XML documents and parses them into a parse tree, which can then be navigated and manipulated to extract desired data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-Easy Navigation: Beautiful Soup provides a simple syntax for navigating the parse tree using popular parsing strategies like tag names, attributes, CSS selectors, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3-Data Extraction: With Beautiful Soup, you can easily extract specific elements, attributes, or text content from web pages, simplifying the process of web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "4-Robust HTML Handling: Beautiful Soup can handle malformed or poorly formatted HTML, making it more tolerant to inconsistencies in web page structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "5-Integration with Other Parsing Libraries: Beautiful Soup can work with different parsers, including the built-in Python parser (html.parser), lxml, and others, allowing you to choose the most suitable parsing engine for your needs.'''\n"
