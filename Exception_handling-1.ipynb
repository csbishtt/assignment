    "'''\n",
    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's\n",
    "instructions. When an exceptional situation arises, Python raises an exception, which is a signal that something unexpected or \n",
    "erroneous has occurred. Exceptions are used to handle errors, bugs, and other exceptional conditions that may occur in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is raised, Python stops the normal execution of the program and looks for an exception handler to deal with \n",
    "the exceptional situation. If an appropriate exception handler is found, the program can gracefully handle the exception and \n",
    "continue execution. If there is no exception handler, the program terminates, and the Python interpreter prints a traceback, \n",
    "which shows the sequence of function calls that led to the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, are a different category of errors. They occur when the Python interpreter encounters code\n",
    "that violates the rules of the Python language. Syntax errors prevent the program from running at all because the Python \n",
    "interpreter cannot understand the code due to the syntax violation. These errors need to be fixed before the program can be \n",
