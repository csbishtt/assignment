    "The three measures of central tendency are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean is the average of a set of numbers. It is calculated by adding up all the values in the data set and then dividing the sum by the total number of values. The mean is sensitive to extreme values, as they can significantly influence its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value of a data set when it is arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an odd number of data points, the median is the middle value. If there is an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is less affected by extreme values compared to the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. In other words, it is the data point that occurs with the highest frequency. A data set can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more (multimodal). Unlike the mean and median, the mode can be used for both numerical and categorical data.\n"

    "Mean:\n",
    "Definition: The mean is the arithmetic average of a dataset. It is calculated by adding up all the values in the dataset and then dividing the sum by the total number of values.\n",
    "Use: The mean is commonly used when dealing with numerical data. It provides a balanced representation of the dataset by taking into account all values equally. However, it can be heavily influenced by extreme values, as they have a direct impact on its value.\n",
    "Median:\n",
    "Definition: The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is ordered in ascending or descending order. If the dataset has an odd number of observations, the median is the middle value. If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",
    "Use: The median is useful when dealing with skewed distributions or when the dataset contains outliers. It is less sensitive to extreme values compared to the mean, making it a robust measure of central tendency.\n",
    "Mode:\n",
    "Definition: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset.\n",
    "Use: The mode is commonly used for categorical data or discrete data with distinct categories. It provides information about the most typical or frequently occurring category in the dataset. In some cases, datasets may have multiple modes (bimodal or multimodal)."
